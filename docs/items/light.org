* a lucent blue flame

   The product of one skilled in the arcane arts, this flame is somehow
tangible, yet intangible in itself. When placing the palm below it, it allows

only effect that can be sensed. When grasped, the intensity of the light it
produces manifolds itself to vast amplitudes, and can be utilized to see in
conditions where normal sight fails.
