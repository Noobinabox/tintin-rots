*** a pair of dark runed vambraces :metal:

These dark runed vambraces have an antique look about them, they were

gauntlets would begin.

These extremely bulky pieces of metal have been crafted to fit around the
arms to provide incredibly protection that will deflect even the most mighty
of blows in combat. The metal used is iron, which surprisingly given the age

quality of this ancient armour.

*** a pair of blue and gold emblazoned vambraces :metal:

Plates of strong steel coated with golden leaf and blue enamel
combine to make beautiful yet robust pieces of armour.
The arm plates along are extremely robust but these have had
small roundels added at the shoulders and elbows to provide
additional protection to these sensitive and vulnerable areas,
the result is restricted movement but far superior absoprtion.
