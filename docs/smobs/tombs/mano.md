# Mano and Puh

## Mano

### Difficulty

A solo character with pragmatism--or that can hit 0% perception--and curse can
kill both Mano and Puh.

### Strategy

In Mano's room is another large spirit named [Puh](#puh). These two hunt and are
very large spirits. The most efficient strategy is for the cleric to engage one
or both, cast pragmatism on himself, and then curse them dead.

## Puh

See [Mano](#mano).
