# The Undead Necromancer

## Difficulty

Possibly one of the harder fights in the tombs. Recommended is a metal-clad
buffer and at bare minimum two hitters and a cleric. Has been done with a group
of three, but it was very, very time consuming.

## Strategy

This fairly benign-looking mob starts out protected by sanctuary, but when
anyone enters his room, he will summon three ghouls to protect and assist him.
Moreover, whenever one ghoul dies, another is summoned in its place. Don't
bother trying to harm the necromancer while any ghouls are left alive; they
protect him from all damage. Eventually the ghouls will stop respawning as they
are killed, allowing the group to clear the room and then kill the necromancer,
who alone is a very easy fight.

The exact workings of these ghouls is not known as of this writing. Experience
has shown that two things lengthen this fight: re-entering the necromancer's
room and extended periods of regeneration between rounds. The best strategy
seems to be to kill them fast, without fleeing, in one round. There are so many
of them, and fast damage is so important, that it is probably a good idea for
the hitters to not even bother with bashing. Let the buffer in metal take all
the damage, let the cleric hallucinate--do not hallucinate/flee--and hope your
buffer has a large number of hitpoints.
