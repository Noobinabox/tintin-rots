# Bithdaur

## Difficulty

A buffer, two or more hitters, and a cleric can manage in one round. Not
bashable.

## Strategy

This mob is a mage, but it is almost more dangerous for the damage its hits do.
That being said, the generic super mob strategy is all that is required here.

Note that this mob has keyword `mage`.

## Reward

[a ruby-tipped staff](/items/weapons.md#a-ruby-tipped-staff) on Bithdaur.
