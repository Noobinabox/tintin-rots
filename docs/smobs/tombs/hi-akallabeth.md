# hi-Akallabeth

## Difficulty

A metal-clad buffer, two or more hitters, and a cleric can manage in one round.

## Strategy

This mob is a ranger, almost comparable to the cowled figure that is part of the
Kabaal quest. Make sure at least one person in the group has search or reveal
life, and try to start the fight without getting ambushed.

Once engaged, the generic super mob strategy is all that is required, although
with one modification: no fleeing unless absolutely necessary. If anyone engaged
to this mob flees while fighting it, the mob will flee as well and start chasing
them. Instead, the cleric either hallucinate/disengage or hallucinates after
being rescued, instead of hallucinate/fleeing.

Note that this mob has keyword `ranger`.

## Reward

[a black two-handed rapier](/items/weapoons.md#a-black-two-handed-rapier) on
hi-Akallabeth.
