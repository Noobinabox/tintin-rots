# Ar-Belzagar

## Difficulty

A metal-clad buffer, three or more hitters, and a cleric should be able to
manage in one round. This mob switches targets. Not bashable.

## Strategy

This is a fairly straightforward warrior-type mob. The generic super mob
strategy is all that is required here.

Note that this mob has keyword `marshal`.

## Reward

* [a bullwhip](/items/weapons.md#a-bullwhip)
* [a thick metal buckler](/items/shields.md#a-thick-metal-buckler)
