# Mauglir

## Load rate

Once per reboot.

## Location

In the room at the very bottom of the catacombs southwest of the Fiddler's Inn.
One-way in.

## Difficulty

Absolutely not solo-able. Recommended is a metal-clad buffer, two or more
hitters, and a cleric.

## Strategy

The primary difficulty with this super mob is that the exit into his room is
one-way and the only door out is locked, no pick, no bash and with the key
loading on Mauglir himself. Additionally, two other mobs also load in this room:
a dark-skinned magi and a dark mage. Neither of these two are very large, but
both cast spells. An effective strategy is for the cleric to hallucinate
and confuse Mauglir--no point in poisoning, since if you don't kill this mob in
one round, you will die--while the hitters all hit Mauglir, then bash Mauglir,
the magi and possibly also the dark mage--depending on how many hitters are
available--never have a hitter bashing more than one target. Once Mauglir
dies, loot his key and unlock/open the hidden `swirlingdoor` north to leave. A
useful note when assigning targets to the bashers is that the dark-skinned magi
has keyword `woman` instead of `man`.
