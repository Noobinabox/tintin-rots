# The Black Huorn

## Load rate

Very low.

## Location

South and a fair bit west of the Old Forest Road Over a Streambed; directly
above the entrance to the maze.

## Difficulty

Solo-able by mages; otherwise requires a metal-clad buffer and three or more
hitters; or a buffer, one or more hitters, and a cleric. Cannot be mentalled.
This mob switches targets, but through a scripted attack. Not bashable.

## Strategy

This is a mob that does not move or hunt. The generic super mob strategy is
usable here with slight modification: the group has to pay attention, as this
mob has two scripted effects that can separate the group.

## Reward

This mob butchers
[a strange, black limb](/items/weapons.md#a-strange-black-limb) which can be
traded for [an engraved staff](/items/weapons.md#an-engraved-staff).

### Trading

Player must be an elf or have a silver leaf. Travel to Thranduil's Hall and
find the weaponsmith. He will craft the limb into
[an engraved staff](/items/weapons.md#an-engraved-staff).
