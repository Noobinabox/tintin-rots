# The Interloper

## Load rate

Standard.

## Location

South and a bit east of the Easterling fort; a short ways east from where the
Southern Road meets the Old Forest Road. Look for a hut of some sort in the
swamp; the door in is hidden named `stonewall`.

## Difficulty

Solo-able by a cleric, although it can be time consuming; otherwise, any
combination of characters that covers the roles of buffer, hitter, basher, and
cleric can do without any real difficulty. Can be mentalled. This mob does not
switch targets. Bashable.

## Strategy

In the Interloper's room are two other mobs: an uruk-hai bodyguard and a great,
filthy beast. The beast hunts, so it is possible to lure it out of the room and
kill it there, or it can be feared away. Fear the uruk-hai bodyguard
away--pragmatism may be necessary--and then once the Interloper is alone the
generic super mob strategy is all that is needed.

A solo cleric should fear both the uruk and the beast out--as to not be
interrupted by a repop--then hallucinate the Interloper and curse/flee it.
