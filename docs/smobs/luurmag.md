# Luurmag

## Load rate

Standard.

## Location

Below an exit named `hole` south of The Narrowing Road.

## Difficulty

Solo-able by any class. Can be mentalled. This mob does not switch targets.
Bashable.

## Strategy

Luurmag has three lithe uruks following him; it is most efficient to separate
these followers, and kill Luurmag while he is solo. To do this, hit Luurmag to
get him to chase, then give his followers some sort of delay, one by one.
Rangers can trap; warriors can bash; clerics can fear. Make sure not to lure
Luurmag back through their rooms in the process. Solo, Luurmag can be killed
fairly easily, although solo warriors should have fairly good defense, and the
ability to do damage while defensive.

## Rewards
