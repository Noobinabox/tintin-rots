# Ungambar

## Load rate

Once per reboot.

## Location

Goblin Gate.

## Difficulty

Arguably one of the two hardest super mobs in the game. Can be done with a
group of four--a buffer, two hitters, and a cleric--although it is time
consuming. More hitters are recommended. Cannot be mentalled. This mob switches
targets. This mob tracks. Not bashable.

## Strategy

### Forces of Light

There are several hidden doors in Ungambar's web and she manipulates them. At
the beginning, someone must `bash webladder`, the first hidden door into her
web, ensuring the group will be able to flee out easily. Once this is done,
someone needs to lure her into the room above  `webladder`, where the fight
should take place.

The main point for this super mob is that the buffer should never lead into her
room when starting a round. This is because the first person into her room gets
dealt a large amount of damage. Get a high-hitpoint hitter to lead in, have the
buffer rescue this person immediately, then use the generic super mob strategy.
This will take several rounds to do.

Note that the room below the webladder is in a lake, which means that either
boats or excellent swimming are required, for the same reason as mentioned in
the strategy for [The Kraken](/smobs/kraken.md).

### Forces of Dark

In addition to the strategy [above](#forces-of-light), the forces of dark can
use orcs to help this go much more smoothly. Have one or two orcs bring as many
warorcs as they can and lose them which the rest of the group gets them metal
from mobs in Goblin's Gate.

After setting up a dozen or more followers, they can all be engaged by ordering
followers to attack, losing those followers and recruiting the next set.
