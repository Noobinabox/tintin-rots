# The Goblin King

## Load rate

Once per reboot.

## Location

Goblin Gate.

## Difficulty

A group of four or larger provides an easy run - a buffer, two or more hitters,
and a cleric. The cleric is absolutely necessary for this super mob. Can be
mentalled. This mob does not switch targets. Bashable.

## Strategy

The immediate area this super mob resides in consists of two rooms: the
northernmost has locked doors east and west, and the southernmost has the Great
Goblin and his assorted bodyguards. Buffing all at once is absurdly painful,
not the least because the Great Goblin himself smites; while this room can be
done with multiple buffers handling a mob or two each, this requires a very
large group, and good coordination. This is why the cleric becomes essential.

The group needs to clear the northernmost room, then stand there with both
doors open; the cleric casts sanctuary on himself, goes south, casts terror,
and flees--goes back north. The goal is to get every mob except the Great
Goblin to flee out of this 2 room area, and lock them out, letting the group
fight the Great Goblin solo without worry about the repop; terror is efficient
because the Great Goblin himself will not move. In fact, none of the mobs in
this 2-room area will hunt or wander on their own accord. The group stands in
the northernmost room so that the buffer will be what the fleeing mobs hit when
entering, thus reducing the risk factor for the cleric. Once the Great Goblin
is solo, the generic super mob strategy is all that is required.
