# The Anaconda

## Load Rate

Standard.

## Location

Southeastern Mirkwood, several zones west of the Southern Road. Look for a
pond, a deep spring, with a muddy wash north of it; down from this spring
enters the anaconda's area. One-way in.

## Difficulty

Solo-able by mages and possibly rangers; a buffer and a damage-dealer can
manage otherwise. Cannot be mentalled. This mob switches targets. Not bashable.

## Strategy

This is a straightforward, semi-hard-hitting mob. He sneaks around in his small
area, hunts, and the only way out is through a locked door. It is pickable, and
the key loads in the corpse below the hidden `scales` in the room with the
door. The first non-one-way exit room when entering his area is a safe-room
where the anaconda will not follow. You need a boat or the ability to swim to
enter his area; boats load in a chest behind a hidden `vines` several rooms
directly west from the muddy wash--the room north of the spring, under which
the anaconda resides.

## Reward

This mob butchers a thick snakeskin.

*TODO*: Identify a thick snakeskin.
