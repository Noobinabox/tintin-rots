# The Warlock

## Load rate

Standard.

## Location

Southeast Mirkwood, a few zones west from the southern reach of the Southern
Road. Look for an iron gate. One-way in.

## Difficulty

Solo-able by mages and clerics. The minimum requirement otherwise is a buffer
and a hitter.

## Strategy

In the warlock's room are three ghouls; they are very aggressive, but die
fairly quickly and don't hit terribly hard. Kill them first, then kill the
warlock. The warlock is slow to attack, which means it is usually possible to
kill the ghouls without having to simultaneously buff the warlock. The ghouls
rescue the warlock.

## Reward

* [a stone ring](/items/clothing.md#a-stone-ring) (2x)
