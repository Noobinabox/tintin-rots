# The Cowled Figure

## Location

Below the `steelslab` on the Old Forest Road just east of the Dark Forest Road.

## Difficulty

Possibly the hardest fight in the entire Kabaal run. Required is a metal-clad
buffer, at minimum two high-OB hitters, and a very attentive cleric. More
hitters are recommended, and a mage will be useful at the end of the fight,
albeit not necessary.

## Strategy:

Once someone enters the room below the steelslab, the cowled figure will appear
in the woods north of the road, a few rooms to the east. He is a ranger-type
mob, which means he sneaks, hides, wanders, and, most importantly, he ambushes.
Not only does he ambush, but he hits hard and fast. Even high-hitpoint hitters
can die from an ambush and two or three hits. So, the most important thing when
fighting this mob is simply not to let him ambush.

Make sure you have at least one person in the group with a decent search skill
since reveal life has too low of a success rate. Once you finally search him
out and the fight begins, the cleric needs to confuse as quickly as possible
and then be very attentive with hallucinate/fleeing. Poison is essential. It is
highly unlikely that the bashers will have much success bashing this mob until
he is confused. Once this mob drops below bloodied, he will start fleeing.

Finishing him off from here can be a very time-consuming process, as he no
longer reliably chases, moves very quickly, sneaks, and hides. The most
efficient way to finish the cowled figure at this point is to have a mage in
the group that can prepare a high-damage spell, then spam it while the person
with search tries to track him down and reveal him. Failing this, simply have
the hitters spam hit and hope for the best.
