# Teff

## Location

Just southwest from the rickety bridge on the Enchanted Path. Look for a black
willow with an exit down.

## Difficulty

Solo-able by mages and clerics. Otherwise, the minimum requirement is a buffer
and a hitter.

## Strategy

Teff is a fairly easy mob, although he has decent OB and hits semi-hard. He
will not leave the two-room tomb area in which he spawns, but he tracks within
it. To get Teff to appear, you must first find Jaiden, and lead him to Teff's
load spot. Jaiden loads in southeastern Mirkwood, on the path, a few zones east
of the Taur-en-Faroth back entrance. Be careful, you must not lead Jaiden
across the bridge south of the crossroads by Lake-town, as the "Lake-town Five"
will appear and kill him.

Jaiden is aligned evil, so good mobs will attack. It is a good idea to have
a cleric to him spelled with insight, sanctuary, and vitalize.
