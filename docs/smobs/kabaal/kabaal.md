# Kabaal the Madman

## Location

From below the steelslab, north enters his area.

## Difficulty

A buffer, two hitters, and a cleric can manage, although it is slow.

## Strategy

When the group enters Kabaal's area, everyone will be teleported to a different
room. This area is roughly square shaped; the exit is behind a door north and
west of the southeast corner. Pick a room to fight in--recommended is one of the
corners, to aid the cleric in hallucinate/fleeing--and have the group meet
there. Once everyone is ready, have someone lure Kabaal from his room behind a
door along the northern edge of the area.

Kabaal hits hard, has a huge number of hitpoints, and has a guardian following
him. Recommended is to kill this guardian first, then fight Kabaal. The generic
super mob strategy is all that is required here; once his guardian is dead,
Kabaal is a fairly easy, albeit long, fight. At awful he will flee, leaving
behind a key and at this point the group needs to decide which reward to get.

## Reward

There are two possible rewards for this super mob; the group can decide to get
one or the other, but not both.

The first load requires the group get a strip of crocodile flesh (butcher a
crocodile in Taur-en-Faroth; these load on the rivers), and take it to Kabaal,
who will be hiding down and north from the room he started in. Give it to him
and he will eat it and disappear--having been cured of his madness--leaving
behind:

* [an enruned mithril spear](/items/weapons.md#an-enruned mithril-spear)
* [a green amulet](/items/magic.md#a-green-amulet)
* [a red bracelet](/items/clothing.md#a-red-bracelet)

A random assortment of etched leather armour pieces also load on the ground
in this room. *TODO: Add references to etched leather gear.*

The second load does not require the crocodile flesh; east and down from the
room Kabaal started in is a chest, in which can load one or more pieces of the
obsidian armour set, and any of the following:

* [a crescent axe](/items/weapons.md#a-crescent-axe)
* [a steel-shafted maul](/items/weapons.md#a-steel-shafted-maul)
* [a many-coloured sword](/items/weapons.md#a-many-coloured-sword)
* [a blood-encrusted sickle](/items/weapons.md#a-blood-encrusted-sickle)

It is unlikely to find more than two or three pieces of obsidian armour each
time. *TODO: Add references to obsidian armour.*
