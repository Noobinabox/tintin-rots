# Garvin

## Location

South and some east from where the Old Forest Road meets the Southern Road.
Look for a cave with trolls, one of which is a bulky troll. Garvin loads in
this area.

## Difficulty

A buffer, two hitters, and a cleric should be able to manage this mob without
difficulty.

## Strategy

Garvin is a cleric-type mob with two bodyguards following him. The simplest way
to kill him is to have the buffer and two bashers enter his room, have the
buffer hit Garvin so he will chase, and have the bashers each bash one of his
bodyguards, then everyone flee. If successful, Garvin will chase before his
bodyguards recover from the bash, allowing the group to fight Garvin solo.
