# Rumblethump

## Load rate

Standard.

## Location

The stone giant fortress northeast of The Narrowing Road. Either `say dwarf` at
the statue guarding the entrance to gain entry or kill it to pass.

## Difficulty

A buffer, a hitter, and a cleric can do without much of a problem. Anyone with
curse that can manage to insight this mob can solo it. This mob has a very
large number of hitpoints, so it is usually more efficient to kill it mentally
rather than physically. Can be mentalled. This mob switches targets. Not
bashable.

## Strategy

This is a straightforward warrior-type mob that does not hunt. When doing solo
simply curse/flee it. In a group, the generic super mob strategy is all that is
required.

## Reward

*TODO*
