# The Ancient Spider

## Load rate

Standard.

## Location

Look for a swamp area a zone or two south from the Uruk Mage Tower. Just east
of this swamp is a mirkwolf corpse--this is in the room name)--where the
entrance is. `mistydoor` is the first of several hidden doors leading inside.
One-way in.

## Difficulty

Solo-able by all classes except mystics, although healing is a must. Cannot be
mentalled. Bashable.

## Strategy

Through a one-way exit is a two room area, northern room safe, southern room
containing the ancient spider and four evil, black spiders. All are aggressive,
all assist, although not quickly; it is possible to take out the evil, black
spiders one by one--fleeing and returning whenever the rest assist--and then
kill the solo ancient spider. The only way out of this two-room area is through
a locked door in the ancient spider's room; the key is butchered from the
ancient spider and while the door is not pickable, it is bashable.

The key is a bulbous spider's eye that is also the reward. It is a somewhat
difficult to butcher item.

## Reward

This mob butchers
[a bulbous spider's eye](/items/magic.md#a-bulbous-spiders-eye).
