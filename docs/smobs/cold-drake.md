# The Cold Drake

## Load rate

Once per reboot.

## Location

Several zones directly south of Vinyanost. One-way in.

## Difficulty

Minimum group size for a smooth run seems to be between five and seven; one
metal-clad buffer, one cleric, and the rest hitters. A secondary or backup
buffer is not necessary, but helpful. Cannot be mentalled. This mob switches
targets. Not bashable.

## Strategy

*TODO*

## Rewards

Exactly one item can be obtained from this super mob each time it is run.

* Any race.
	[a triple-headed morningstar](/items/weapons.md#a-triple-headed-morningstar).
	Loads behind a hidden door near	where Targen was first found.
* A dwarf gives Targen's corpse to his spirit, get
	[a mithril mask](/items/weapons.md#a-mithril-mask).
* A hobbit gives Targen's corpse to his spirit, get
	[light mithril mail shirt](/items/weapons.md#light-mithril-mail-shirt).
* A human gives Targen's corpse to his spirit, get
	[light mithril mail boots](/items/weapons.md#light-mithril-mail-boots).
* An elf gives Targen's corpse to his spirit, get
	[an ornate mithril sword](/items/weapons.md#an-ornate-mithril-sword).
