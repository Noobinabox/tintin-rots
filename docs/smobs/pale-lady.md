# The Pale Lady

## Load rate

Once per reboot.

## Location

The tower at the southern edge of the Dark Lake.

## Difficulty

Arguably one of the two hardest super mobs in the game. A group of seven to
nine seems to have a good chance for a successful run. Fewer are possible, more
are better. A buffer is not needed, but an attentive and knowledgeable cleric
is absolutely essential. Cannot be mentalled. This mob switches targets.
Bashable, but is very difficult.

## Strategy

The strategy for this super mob has many parts, all of which must be done.

First, a short ways southwest of the doors to her tower, there is a werewolf by
the name of Draugluin. You must kill this mob and butcher a clear jewel from
its corpse. This jewel, when held as a light source, makes the doors to the
tower open.

Second, you need the sun plate. This item is located in the tombs just
southwest of Lake-town on the ground. You need the ornate key from
[The Warlock](/smobs/warlock.md) to access it.

Once you have these items, you need to lure Ar-Grimlakik into the room that you
will be fighting. This mob has an enormous amount of hitpoints and is aggressive
to the Pale Lady; he will serve as a buffer, albeit one that does not rescue.
He is located at the bottom of the mausoleum, but will not chase you above
ground. You need to open the secret entrance into her tower to lure him into
position. In one of the rooms off the main staircase in the tower, you will find
a candelabra. Pull this, and it will open a secret door; behind this secret door
is a lever. Pull the lever and a secret door at the base of the staircase will
open, allowing you to move between the mausoleum and the tower. Ar-Grimlakik
will follow you into the tower via this route. Lure him to the balcony room
behind the door at the very top of the staircase. You need the key on the
vampire west of the aforementioned lever for this door. Lock him in. Now you're
ready to start the actual fight.

The Pale Lady takes on two forms, that of a giant, shadowy bat, and her humanoid
form. You must fight her in her bat-form until she flees, at which point you
will be able to find her in her humanoid form and defeat her.

Her bat-form is out around the Dark Lake during each night, for the entire
night. However, if you try to fight her humanoid form during the night, you will
find she regenerates too quickly to kill. This means that at 2 minutes until
sunrise, the group needs to move outside the doors of the tower and wait for the
bat to appear. Once she appears, fight her there, and once she gets to bloodied
and flees, it will be almost sunrise. Run immediately to the room you left
Ar-Grimlakik in at this point. Here you will find her in her humanoid form.

Drop the sun plate on the ground in the room where you are fighting her; this
helps disrupt her insane regeneration. The cleric needs to hallucinate/flee
only. Confuse, poison, etc. will not stick to her. Hitters hit, fleeing whenever
she turns to them if you are using Ar-Grimlakik as the sole buffer. Bashing her
is very useful, although with less than 220 OB the success rate is low. If you
have timed this right, and the sun rises at the very beginning of this fight, it
is a relatively simple--and short--affair to hit her down to awful, at which
point she vanishes, leaving her gear on the ground.

If she starts to visibly heal and continues to do so even after the sun has
risen, the fight is probably lost, and you should try again the next night,
starting over at the luring of Ar-Grimlakik, once he respawns.
